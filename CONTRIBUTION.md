# Contributing to PokeQuest

## Developing with Github

We used Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
1. Make sure your code lints
1. Issue that pull request

## MIT Software License

When you submit your code, your submissions will be under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Use a consistent coding style

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be under the MIT License owned by The Weds Meetup.
